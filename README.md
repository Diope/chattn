I've been messing with Vue on the side for fun, this is just a small CRUD project with Firebase backend to get better acquainted with Vue and Vuex.

It's a small Twitter clone, using Firebase as the backend (I created another Twitter clone with React/Redux but built my own backend and...I need to start using Firebase more often lmao)

## Post project notes:

I am very much a fan of Vuex, and it feels MUCH more straightforward and easy to wrap one's head around over Redux, but I fully admit this could be because I've learned the Flux architecture by bashing my head on Redux for months (and honestly, I'm still not a guru or even remotely spectacular at Redux, I still have to look up a lot even on more obvious things. As an example, different actions for call to a backend API and for React actions was something that JUST clicked with me barely a month ago...)

Accessing store state from different components feels so much more simple than Redux, and Vue as a UI rendering layer gels so well with it.
