I've been messing with Vue on the side for fun, this is just a small CRUD project with Firebase backend to get better acquainted with Vue.

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
yarn run lint
```
